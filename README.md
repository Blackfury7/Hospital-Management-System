* Both doctors and patients can sign up and sign in to the platform.

* The doctor's sign-up process is verified by the manager before the doctor can log in.

* Patients can book appointments, which are then reviewed by the manager to schedule an appropriate doctor or adjust the appointment time. 

* The patient is notified of any changes made to their appointment.

* Doctors have the ability to create reports for patients who have visited them and to view a list of all patients they have treated.
